      Due to my practice in philosophy, I have a lot of experience asking good questions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the premier tips for asking good questions are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give a specific, simple example of what you're asking about. No frills. Contextualize the problem being talked about.<br><br>When it comes to programming questions, this often means providing a simplified version of the problem. It's great practice to replace unnecessary details with toy phrases like <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, and to include this simplified version of the problem in a question on StackOverflow.</li>
      <li>Don't actualy ask a question--make a statement instead. For example, instead of it may be tempting to ask little more than , "how would I use Bootstrap to vertically align text in a div?" If you're expressing a point of view, state it as a theory.  "In this situation, it seems to me like I should do such-and-such. Does that seem on track?"</li>
      <li>The best questions are the ones that get asked. The best ones that get asked penetrate to general principles but apply them sraightforwardly to a case.</li>
    </ul>
