      John Taylor Gatto is a veteran schoolteacher and prominent critic of the American educational establishment.  Some of his most important criticisms are encapsulated in a piece called <a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=11375">"The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher"</a>, which is the first chapter of his 1992 book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BNg8tdL2IdQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=call+me+mr.+gatto+please&source=bl&ots=hTLY9JDmVu&sig=maejtQhVq4IAbduGhHv8H8ftKKc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=damVVYfBBoTb-QHb0774Dg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=call%20me%20mr.%20gatto%20please&f=false"><em>Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling</em></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essay is jaw-droppingly incisive both in its biting criticisms of the educational establishment and in how truly its criticisms seemed to hit home for me.  I can write about how it speaks so accurately about my own experience.  But first I want to brainstorm about how the criticisms can be taken to heart.  This is because I would like in future years to engage in after-school teaching of some combination of web development and critical thinking/philosophy/effective altruism.
    </p>

    <h3>"Lessons"</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Confusion</strong>: children are presented with an excessive amount of facts in a disjointed, incoherent order.</li>    
      <li><strong>Class Position</strong>: children are taught to have average aspirations by being constantly compared to their classmates, separated by barriers of achievement that they often feel stuck in.</li>
      <li><strong>Indifference</strong>: children are taught not to care about anything too much, but to appear that they do: they have incentives to turn on their enthusiasm during class sessions (and off again when the bell rings) but seldom to leave it on long enough to finish a project about which they are intrinsically motivated.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Dependency</strong>: children must surrender their independent points of view to the formulaic assessments of the academic system.</li>
      <li><strong>Intellectual Dependency</strong>: kids get little encouragement to think for themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Provisional Self-Esteem</strong>: children are trained to tie their self-evaluations to teachers' incremental assessments of their work, and even implicitly of their character.  Kids aren't considered qualified to evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of their own work.</li>
      <li><strong>One Can't Hide</strong>: children are without private spaces, subject incessantly to surveillance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Antidotes: Project Creation</h3>
    <p>Studying Gatto's critcisms carefully, we can discern a pattern regarding a suitable alternative educational model.  The idea is that learners get more motivation and meaningful, reusable experience from <em>taking creative ownership of personal projects they share with the world</em>.  Here's a rundown of how I would label and describe seven antidotes to the "lessons" Gatto describes.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Narrative</strong>: lessons learned and skills developed should be presented as a coherent, harmonious story that connects the human experience with what is learned.</li>

      <blockquote>Meaning, not disconnected facts, is what sane human beings seek, and education is a set of codes for processing raw facts into meaning.</blockquote>

      <li><strong>Mobility through Creativity</strong>: through creative self-applications and self-promotion, individuals can corner markets aspired to by none of their colleagues; through motivated creativity everyone can resist being average.</li>

      <li><strong>Motivated projects</strong>: children should select tasks they care about, perhaps by having more and fewer projects that are truly theirs, on which they can concentrate for more than a few hours at a time during the days.</li>

      <li><strong>Emotional Independence</strong>: children should be encouraged to speak and feel for themsleves creatively.</li>

      <li><strong>Intellectual Independence</strong>: by pursuing their own projects, children can gain a sense of ownership, exercise thier curiosity, and practice the organizational skills needed to finish a project.</li>

      <li><strong>Project Ownership</strong>: children should be trained to embrace a holistic sense of self-evaluation, to think about their work as a series of projects, the value and reach of which can be judged by multiple qualified judges as well as the broader masses, as well as the children themselves.</li>

      <li><strong>Trust</strong>: children should be trusted to take responsibilities for themselves in a variety of key circumstances.</li>

      <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
      <p>I had considerable problems with being motivated to take small, "busy-work" type tasks seriously throughout primary and secondary school.  I was a paradigm case of a student who was only moderately above average despite irresponsibility when it came to assignments I perceived as trivial.</p>
      

      <p>Because I was more motivated to play with my guitar and my video games than to read every last detail of my history or English books, I wound up with something like a 3.4 GPA in high school---definitely not terrible, but more mediocre than I was capable of.  I disproportionately sank my teeth into the few projects that I was <em>allowed</em> by constant peer pressure to care about---a few modestly-sized projects once or twice a semester.  </p>

      <p>Largely, however, I think I overcame these habits by taking multiple philosophy degrees---bachelor's, master's, and doctorate.  A few great teachers challenged me to think for myself and re-evaluate my belief system, to come up with my own paper topics and own theses, and then to present them at conferences.  Much more thoroughly I came to appreciate the interrelations of the various disciplines---philosophy now seemed to me at least as connected to mathematics as to language arts.  Finally I found an arena in which I was invited to take control of my intellectual and professional identity.  From there, I finally realized how interesting and important learning was, how the details I could have learned in courses I never took but deeply wished I had---for example on economics, chemistry, advanced calculus, or computer science---could contribute to mastery of skills that would aid me in projects that would define me as a person.</p>
      <p>Now that I'm back to learning a set of hard skills---the programming language skills that I will use in my programming career---I can definitely, usually, see the point of the exercises I've been going through.  My selling point is my portfolio, and the tactics we build will contribute to my future portfolio's general impressiveness as well as my future job performance, which will use these skills directly.  But I also understand how these skills can be <em>used</em> for purposes loftier than mere paycheck-earning.  Technological innovation is a source of empowerment for anyone with an idea to share.</p>
      <p>Still, however, I do feel that I'm sometimes not entirely out of the rut of treating exercises as busy work, putting in minimal effort to build skills I'm commanded to.</p>

      <p>Instead, I ought to take programming exercises as <em>suggestions about how to choose to develop myself</em> from people with seasoned experience.  I can choose to make things I can show off, to grow organically in directions that my colleagues haven't even thought to, gaining specialized expertise.</p>
