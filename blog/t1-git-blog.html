      Version control (AKA revision control or source control) is the management of changes to documents, notably software code. Two important features are especially notable. First, it allows multiple collaborators to contribute to ("commit" to) a project, which can be very useful for teams. Secondly, version control alows collaborators to store save points. If they need to retrace their steps, they can restore to any of those points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is a popular version control system that is "distributed", meaning that peers work on parallel copies of the complete master repository. They then may choose to merge changes into the master repository. (This can be distinguished from more centralized variets of version control, where indiviudals only work on pieces of a repository at once, and tasks may be more rigidly delegated.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Git encourages collaborators to keep track of changes, and commit messages describing changes are stored along with each commit each time someone commits changes to a repository. This allows collaborators to better understand what each other are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub.com is a fantastic place to store code because it's readily accessible on the internet by anyone who might want to use your source code or contribute to your project. Not only do you get potential contributors this way, you also can help empower the projects of others.
