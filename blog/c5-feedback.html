    During the remote portion of Dev Bootcamp ('Phase 0'), students participate in '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>' at least three times a week.  The pair of students video-call each other and assign one person to be 'driver' (the one who will actually do the typing, implementing ideas into code) and the other to be the 'navigator' (the one who leads brainstorming and the direction to take with future problem-solving).  Pair programming is common in the software development industry because it often enhances the quality of the software (the product is often simpler, more maintainable, and contains fewer bugs).

    DBC also coordinates a helpful system of organized feedback, where each person anonymously evaluates their pair with an open response and then a seven-item questionnaire.  Each person gets to see the anonymous feedback intended for him or her after enough accumulate to make it reasonably anonymous.  But the feedback only gets through if it is rated by members of the cohort as 'Specific, Actionable, and Kind'.  This is one of the many ways in which DBC cultivates holistic improvements in its students' mental and interpersonal lives.

    It's useful for me to reflect on my pairing sessions and on the feedback I've recently received from them so I can be a better colleague.  (This is not unlike wearing baseball catcher's equipment and asking someone to peg you with baseballs all over your body so you get better at stopping the ball.  You feel vulnerable and at risk as the catcher, and worried about hurting the other as the thrower; yet it's clear that the risk of injury is minimal and it's helpful to the catcher as a player as well as to his team.)
    <h5>Frustration: That Old Programmer's nemesis</h5>
    An emotion I commonly feel when programming (in pairs or otherwise) is frustration.  It's an understandable emotion to experience when your program returns errors and you can't pinpoint the source, or when you just don't know enough methods in the Ruby language to accomplish a task straightforwardly.  This has occurred in pair programming situations for the very same reasons.  (It's also possible that in the future I'll feel frustrated with my pair or her way of doing things, but fortunately that hasn't really happened yet to a memorable degree.)

    Strategies for dealing with frustration include:
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Cultivate mindfulness.</strong> </em>Understanding my emotion is the first step to controlling them or even harnessing their positive, motivating powers.</li>
      <li><em><strong>Start from simple cases.</strong> </em>I've found it very helpful and relieving to start with simpler versions of the problem, test solutions to that, and then add complexity bit by bit to work up to the actual problem I'm facing. No reason this can't be done during a pair.</li>
      <li><em><strong>Reference or revise pseudocode.</strong> </em>Directions can help you get out of a rut, just like a map.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Gift of Mutual Edification</h5>
    The main reward of pair programming--especially when we're a pair of novices--is that we'll teach each other things.  At its best, my pairs and I have both learned tips and tricks from each other, and we've often gotten our work done rather fast (in at least two cases, I know we finished faster than I would have alone).  This kind of thing makes it worth it on average even in sessions where the pairing process slows me down.  Not only does it in general help us learn, but getting to know each other and know about how other people operate makes the process well worth it.  It's just generally fun to be social while working.

    For all these reasons, I really wish the world of academic philosophy that I came from worked more in teams and coached students to write together in teams.  You'd see the parallel results: people teaching each other things, learning how each other operate, and enjoying each other's company.
    <h3>Lessons from Feedback</h3>
    Receiving feedback about my pair sessions was enlightening.  So far the major lesson is that I sometimes people too much, in a couple of senses.
    <h5>Lesson #1: I sometimes operate too fast for others.</h5>
    Some comments around this theme: "You were very patient. I think sometimes though it might help you to slow down a little"; "you tended to offer solutions before I even had time to finish reading the task or come up with my own answers"; "I encourage Jay to continue being open minded to other perspectives and perhaps allow more opportunities for the other person to answer questions and take the initiative".

    Pair programming--and life at a tech startup, and life in general--is often less like a race of independent runners, and more like a group run where people push each other to run at the best pace they can reasonably achieve, not faster.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Practice patience: </em></strong>Sometimes (as driver, for example) I need to wait for others to demonstrate understanding of the task rather than soliciting instructions super quickly.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Lay off the caffeine: </em></strong>Because, really.  <img class="alignnone" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/5d/95/aa/5d95aaf1c23716d9993aedfcc3f91486.jpg" alt="" /></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Lesson #2: Sometimes Am domineering or impatient as a navigator</h5>
    Nobody explicitly said this, but in sessions where I did a lot of navigating, some of my pairs indicated that they "Mostly" rather than "Always" felt "respected and considered" and/or "motivated and inspired" by me.  I suspect that this is a tiny reflection of another kind of "Type A" trait (one I happen to share with certain relatives): I can come off as gruff, domineering, bossy, or irritable to others if they don't understand my instructions fully or immediately.  I recall feeling that this is likely to increase as frustrations with the problem at hand increases in difficulty or frustratingness, or if my pair and I diverge in how we tend to do things.  This is an obstacle to building trust and rapport in any relationship, perhaps most importantly with colleagues and potential colleagues, where each contact is an audition that need not be repeated.

    Here are some steps I will take to prevent Gruffy McGrufferson from taking the navigational controls:
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=aFxKt1sexVc#t=21.75">Morgan Freeman</a> (or better yet, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/npr/memorial-day-in-2014-craig-windham">Craig Windham</a>): </em></strong>Adopt a calmer, more meditative manner in my demeanor and vocal tone.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Smile right away: </em></strong>Try to project warmth at the outset of meeting with someone.  (<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/62/69K40/index.xml?section=topstories">Apparently</a> I get a tenth of a second to establish trust, so it's important to <a href="https://www.dailyworth.com/posts/2245-balancing-being-liked-and-respected-at-work">start with warmth</a>.)</li>
      <li><strong><em>Choose non-domineering phrases</em></strong> to frame my suggestions. Some ideas are: "Here's one idea for how to do this...."; "What we need is a method that can [do such-and-such]..."; "Why don't we [do x]".</li>
      <li><strong><em>Make 'em think it's their idea: </em></strong>I've been told this is a good way to inspire people, although I'm no expert on how to accomplish this.  Maybe I should read <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5715912/how-to-plant-ideas-in-someones-mind">this</a>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Listen</em><em> more</em></strong>, even as navigator.  I need to be open to the driver's ideas, showing respect for those ideas. They often are at least as good as ones I have.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Recognize, sincerely, the pair's achievements.
    </em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>Be transparent</em></strong> in my reasoning as much as possible, including by methodically going carefully through pseudocode even when I feel like there's no need.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Begin empathizing from the beginning</em></strong>: try to figure out the other person's thoughts and feelings in order to gauge how they will respond to certain tactics.</li>
    </ul>
