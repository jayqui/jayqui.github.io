      Three grand values guide my life: beauty, love, and improvement of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my truest moments of bliss have been moments of absorption in music. The universal language speaks loudly and proudly through my voice, my obsession with rhythm, and my inner insistence on making music as carefully or raucously as I can. To <em>whatever</em> extent I end up publicizing musical creations, I need the outlet and must reserve time to engage musically whenever reasonably possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I introspect on what provides me not momentary chills of giddiness but gentle waves of satsifaction, I see little beyond the faces of those I love. What could replace quality time filled with caring attention for the souls we call our friends and families? Knowing and understanding and appreciating their idiosyncrasies and odd nuances is the ineffably important, irreplaceable, most enriching aspect of human life. Perhaps no bond lasts; even so, without my bonds to others, past and present, I would be a sliver of what I ever was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride, however, should be strongest placed where our actions' effects are the strongest. If I had a son and I could bequeath him ten billion dollars, giving him all of it would be a mockery of the beauty of my love for him, a mere shadow of the brilliance it could have if we shared a great deal of our love and resources with the hurting world who needs it. My proudest accomplishment is also my greatest: deciding to click a button on the internet. Regularly donating money to those I can help substantially is more significant for me than perhaps anything I else can do. Helping others, financially or otherwise, cannot replace the irreplaceable beauty of love, or the supreme kindness that is the gift of music. But it is the truest, deepest mark I leave, even if no one sees it.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do I fare along these dimensions? Can I hop on a scale and weigh up to quick assessment? Of course not; I'm immensely underqualified as a rater of my own life--not knowing whom to compare myself to or which possible versions of myself I could reasonably have become. And yet it is reasonable for me to <em>strive</em> to live out these values specifically in very specific ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time to devote myself to goddamn GarageBand and FruityLoops and getting a metronome and recording some vocals for some goddamn tracks finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time to devote myself to writing and calling people regularly: O, C, Ch, E, MA, and so on. And I need to make sure I don't neglect my parents or take them for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time for me to recognize that my working hours, along with my training-to-soon-finally-be-working hours, are not really for me. These are hours invested for starving and sick kids in developing countries and for neglected, abused animals who know nothing but pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's time for me to ensure that I'm staying up on the effective altruism and animal rights movements so that I <em>can</em> still properly advise people on where to learn about important volunteering and giving opportunities. Including by attending <a href="http://dotimpact.im/">.impact</a> meetings and working on meaningful technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forever concentrating on beauty, love, and impact will prevent me from falling into the rut of anyone's stereotype. I can be not just a programmer who sits and writes JavaScript programs all day; not just an effective altruist geek; not just a dude who's dating so-and-so or who fiddles with his guitar sometimes. I can be technological efficiency enthusiast who makes meaningful improvements--technological, financial, spiritual--to the lives of great numbers of neglected souls, living out my passion for others through quality expressions of my appreciation not only of them, but of the beauty inside them and outside them and around us all.
