      <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"><strong>The Mind Styles Model</strong></a> is  a model of learning styles due to the education researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gregorc">Anthony Gregorc</a>. It is helpful for understanding one's own learning style. (There are, however, many serious and important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gregorc#Supporting_evidence">worries about its reliability</a>. So I'll reflect on it and its implications with a few grains of salt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic theory is that a learner's <strong>perceptual</strong> tendencies are either <em>concrete</em> (one focuses on immediately perceptible objects around one) or <em>abstract</em> (one focuses on learning general principles).  And a learner's <strong>ordering ability</strong> is either <em>sequential</em> (one tends to process information linearly, step-by-step) or <em>random</em> (one's mind organizes information in chunks, not necessarily in a particular order). 
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">an initial self-test</a> I came out as clearly an <em>abstract sequential</em> thinker/learner (pretty predictable for a lover of philosophy who has chosen to go into programming). I am orderly, intellectual, critical, a judger, and I love gaining comprehension of general principles and understanding their implications. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This has at least two implications for my programming career: one regarding time management and another regarding working with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regarding time management</strong>, when Iâ€™m faced with distractions, it can be difficult or frustrating for me to pick back up where I left off. I often feel like I have to retrace the steps of a process before I can resume work. This can be inefficient. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To remedy this, one strategy that I find really helpful is capturing stream-of-consciousness thoughts in text files.  This helps me step out of the boundaries placed on me by my thinking style and allows me to collect random thoughts so that I can harness them systematically at a later point.  (It also helps me clear my mind, which is very important for helping me sleep!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regarding working in teams</strong>, when colleagues give me information or solve problems in an order that doesn't seem linear to me, I can sometimes be frustrated and tempted to withdraw and attempt to fly solo on a problem. Solo work has its place, but there will be many contexts, especially in software development, where working with others is important for my team to be efficient, as well as for workplace morale.
    </p>
    <p>
      One strategy for combatting this is parallel to the previous strategy I've discussed: taking notes on what we've been up to so I can put the pieces in order later. A second strategy is simply to appreciate the value of teamwork: there is division of labor to harness the competitive advantages of each team member, and team members educate each other and stimulate each other to learn new information. Obtaining these valuable forms of stimulation at all is usually more important than obtaining them in a certain order.
