    <p>People can often face anxiety about being a member of a stereotyped group. They can be anxious due to fear of things like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>failing and allowing the stereotype to seem true of themselves</li>
      <li>failing in a way that reflects poorly on the stereotyped category they fall into, exacerbating the stereotype</li>
      <li>feeling special pressure to perform (performance anxiety) because of the extra attention drawn to them by their stereotype</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any of these things can be thought of as 'stereotype threat'. This is a very real phenomenon discovered through psychology research. Keystone findings include that African-American students perform more poorly than their European-American counterparts if and only if reminded of racial stereotypes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">see Wikipedia</a>).</p>

    <h2>Unconscious Stereotypes</h2>

    <p>As a white male, I have almost never been in a minority. (The two exceptions: my recent embrace of atheism and veganism. But these honestly don't disadvantage me much.)</p>

    <p>But a relevant concept to hyper-majority folks like me is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype">implicit bias</a>: the tendency to unconsciously judge people according to stereotypes. According to leading research, it turns out implicit biases affect us all profoundly. We all pretty much carry around biased attitudes toward people of certain groups, even if we ourselves are among those groups, and these attitudes can be extremely difficult to suppress. This isn't the place for a full literature review, but here is some great further explanation (<a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/how-unethical-are-you">"How Unethical Are You?"</a>), and here is site that lets you take tests on your own implicit biases (<a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html">Project Implicit</a>).</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL9__gD88xk">This four-minute video</a> presents perhaps the most accessible overview. Example findings include: [1] otherwise identical academic CVs with male names as opposed to female names got higher ratings, and otherwise [2] identical resumes with white-sounding names as opposed to black-sounding names got 50% more callbacks from potential employers. Research has also revealed other workplace-related implicit biases against [3] LGBTQ folks and [4] women with children.</p>

    <h2>Fighting Unconscious Stereotypes</h2>
    <p>In the software programming workplace, it's important to try to avoid projecting implicit biases against others, as much as that is possible. Avoiding the influence or projection of implicit bias is my major means of reducing stereotype threat to others.</p>

    <p>Here are some strategies for reducing implicit bias, via <a href="http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Topics/Gender%20and%20Racial%20Fairness/IB_Strategies_033012.ashx">this helpful document</a>:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Avoid evaluating people’s capabilities:
    <ul>
      <li>when  highly emotional (e.g. in a state of anger, disgust, or happy emotion)</li>
      <li>without referencing clear criteria for evaluation</li>
      <li>if thinking of people in radicalized or genderized terms
    when engaging in low-effort cognitive processing. That is, make every effort to postpone judgment of who someone is or how well they’ll perform until you have ample, objective data about their past performances.</li>
      <li>when engaging in distracted or pressured decision-making circumstances</li>
      <li>unless you’re forced to justify your judgment to others</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
      <li>Raise awareness about implicit stereotypes</li>
      <li>Seek to identify and consciously acknowledge real group and individual differences</li>
      <li>Routinely check thought processes and decisions for possible bias</li>
      <li>Increase contact with and concentration on counter-stereotypes</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And I would add:</p>

    <ol start="6">
      <li>Replace race concepts altogether with ethnicity concepts. (Race concepts view group-related differences as fixed, inborn, and all-or-nothing. But ethnicity concepts view group-related differences as cutural, dynamic, learnable, shareable, flexible, mixable, and not all-or-nothing.)</li>
    </ol>
