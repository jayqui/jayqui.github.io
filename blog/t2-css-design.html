      You may be familiar with HTML, which provides the structure for a web page, and CSS, which is the language for stylesheets that give formatting to the HTML outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you're like me, one of the hardest things to understand when first learning CSS is the <code>display</code> property. To understand it properly, we have to understand how display works on an HTML page.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we have to understand the structure of an HTML page. Some elements are <em>block level</em> elements, meaning that they appear to start on a new line in the browser window. Examples inlcude the tags <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>ul</code>, and <code>li</code>. Other elements are <em>inline</em> elements, meaning that they appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements. Examples include the tags <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>em</code>, and <code>img</code>. One of the chief uses of the <code>div</code> tag is to enclose content in block-level boxes so it can be formatted. The <code>span</code> element has a parallel function: it encloses inline content so that it can be formatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common CSS keywords that will be applied to the <code>display</code> property will be, unsurprisingly, <strong><code>inline</code></strong> and <strong><code>block</code></strong>. These will be used when we want to change the display property. For example, we might want to display an ordered list horizontally. <code>li</code> tags are normally block elements, but we can use CSS to change their <code>display</code> to <code>inline</code>. For a second example, we might want to display several images in a row, and to do this, we would set their <code>display</code> property to <code>inline</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The display property can take various other keywords (full list <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp">here</a>), but the most important one to mention here is <strong><code>inline-block</code></strong>. The inside of an element with <code>inline-block</code> formatting is formatted as a block-level box, but the element itself is formatted as an inline-level box. Basically, <code>inline-block</code> elements are <a href="http://learnlayout.com/inline-block.html">like <code>inline</code> elements except they can have width and height</a>. This can be a good way to make rows of boxes, for example. For example, check out <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jayqui/aradxzcf/">this JSFiddle</a>.
