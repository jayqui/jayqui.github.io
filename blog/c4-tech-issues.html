    <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/a-developers-guide-to-the-wild-west-of-app-discovery/">An interesting new article</a> by Raphael Ouzan on TechCrunch highlights the difficulties and tips for getting potential users to discover new apps. This is important for aspiring developers, so I'll summarize a few of the tips here.
    <ul>
      <li>Major problems facing app discovery include the poor organization of the app stores in the Google and Apple duopoly. The consequences:
        <ul>
          <li>80% of apps fail to show up under any of Apple's category lists</li>
          <li>Most iPhone owners don't even download a single new app in a month</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    So here are some tips for how to structure the build of an app and how to coordinate an app launch.

    For deciding where to begin:
    <ol>
      <li> Decide on a platform (currently the main options are iOS and Android) in part by researching your target demographic.</li>
    </ol>
    About app development:
    <ol start="4">
      <li>Because with the Apple iStore, it can take 1-2 weeks to get a submission approved, consider testing your app privately (such as through a Facebook group) to refine the product and user experience.</li>
      <li>Try to align yourself with the app carriers' strategic goals. (Ouzan's team faced a last-minute demand that they also release a tablet version of the app, because Google is currently trying to boost overall tablet app quality.)</li>
    </ol>
    About promotion:
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Since App Store rankings put a lot of emphasis on velocity (and acceleration?) of downloads and ratings, push as hard as possible to promote the app at the start through as many channels as possible. Try to start as close to the top as possible. Getting featured in App Store search results will build on itself.</li>
      <li>Having connections helps get products featured. That's why Ouzan's "Cowboy Tip #2" is "Donâ€™t be shy about asking for intros to people on the App Store and Google Play team."</li>
      <li>Getting good press can help Apple or Google decide to feature the product, so reach out to some good journalists, perhaps while in 'pending developer release' mode.</li>
    </ol>
