      <em>Arrays</em> are essentially ordered lists of data. In Ruby (along with many other languages), the items in the list can be any kind of object. And the lists are indexed by their place in the list, starting with 0 and going on until the end of the array. (In other words, they are <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">integer-indexed</a>".)
   </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">official documentation</a> on Ruby arrays contains a great deal of helpful information and examples, but I'll share a few helpful and overlooked ones before then contrasting Ruby's arrays with hashes.  So without further ado, here are today's top 5 cool facts about Ruby arrays:
    </p>
    <ol reversed>

      <li>While the typical array syntax is <p><code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "dragonfruit", "elderberry", "fig"]</code></p> arrays can also be created by splitting items via whitespace: <p><code>fruits = %w(apple banana cherry dragonfruit elderberry fig)</code></p> creates the very same array.</li>

      <li>Every beginner learns that Ruby array items can be accessed by the array name and the item position; for example, from the previous array, <p><code>fruits[2] # => "cherry"</code></p>. But it's less well known that several consecutive array can be accessed when a pair of arguments are put between the square brackets: <code>fruits[2,3] = ["cherry", "dragonfruit", "elderberry"]</code>.</li>

      <li>Several items in a row can be created with the <code>new</code> method: <p><code>three_greetings = Array.new(3, "hi") # => ["hi", "hi", "hi"]</code></p></li>

      <li>To remove duplicate items from an array, use the <code>uniq!</code> method (or, for a non-destructive method that preserves the original array and returns a copy of that array with duplicates eliminated, use <code>uniq</code>). Relatedly, if you have some <code>nil</code> values that you want to remove from your array, you should use the <code>compact</code> method.<p><code>nihilism = [42, "meaning", "meaning", "of", "of", "life", "life", nil, nil, nil]</p><p>nihilism.uniq # => [42, "meaning", "of", "life", nil]</p><p>nihilism.compact # => [42, "meaning", "meaning", "of", "of", "life", "life"]</code></p></li>

      <li>Beginners often learn about the traditional methods of adding to and removing from the end (<code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>, respectively) and the front (<code>unshift</code> and <code>shift</code>, respectively) and the aesthetically pleasing shovel (<code><<</code>) operator. But what they don't always learn is how to add and remove from the middle of an array. Here are the three relevant methods in action (assume these are each performed on the original <code>fruits</code> array): <p><code>fruits.delete_at(2) # => "cherry", and "cherry" is removed from the array</code></p> <p><code>fruits.insert(1, "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FUM") # => ["apple", "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FUM", "banana", "cherry", "dragonfruit", "elderberry", "fig"]</code></p> <p><code>fruits.delete("banana") # => ["apple", "cherry", "dragonfruit", "elderberry", "fig"]</code></p> </li>
    </ol>

        <em>Hashes</em>, by contrast, are key-value pairs. I'm out of time to share cool things about hashes, but a list of many, many cool methods for hashes can be found  cool that there is to know about hashes can be found in the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html">official documentation</a> or at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_hashes.htm">this awesome tutorial</a> by TutorialsPoint.
